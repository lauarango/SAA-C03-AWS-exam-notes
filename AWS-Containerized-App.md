## Containerized App with ECS

> You need to have an app to deploy (any programming language).

I made this diagram in case you want to try the lab all by yourself!

Here you will find how to:

- Create a Docker Image
  
- Push that image to an ECR repository
  
- Deploy an application using Amazon ECS and Amazon Fargate 
  
For me, decoupling any process and making things one by one is way easier. Here you have the key parts of this "lab":

1. [Part 1: Create Docker Application Image](./AWS-Docker-App-Image.md)
2. [Part 2: Create Amazon ECR Repository and Add the Docker Image to it](./AWS-ECR-Repository.md)
3. [Part 1: Deploy an Application with ECS and Fargate by using an Image from ECR](./AWS-ECS-and-Fargate-Deployment-Using-ECR-Image.md)

> You can find this tutorial in CloudQuest built by AWS directly!
