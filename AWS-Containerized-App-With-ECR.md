## Containerized App with ECS

For me, decoupling any process and making things one by one is way easier. Here you have the key parts of this "lab":

1. [Part 1: Create Docker Application Image](./AWS-Docker-App-Image.md)
2. [Part 2: Create Amazon ECR Repository and Add the Docker Image to it](./AWS-ECR-Repository.md)
3. [Part 1: Deploy an Application with ECS and Fargate by using an Image from ECR](./AWS-ECS-and-Fargate-Deployment-Using-ECR-Image.md)
